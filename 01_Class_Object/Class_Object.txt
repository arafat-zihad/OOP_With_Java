What is Class?
Class is a blueprint/template for creating an object. It doesn't take space in memory, it tells you what type of information an object will hold and what it can do.
Component:
Data -> Properties / Attributes / What type of information
Method -> Behavior / Function / What it can do


Example: 
If a class is Car, 
Data -> color, model, speed 
Method -> break, accelerate 

	Class Car {
		color;	 	//data
		model; 		//data 
		speed; 		//data
		break();		//method
		Accelerate	//method 
}

What is an Object?

An object is an instance (Sample of class) of a class that is created by using class blueprint. It takes up space like other variables in memory. 

Syntax: 
	Classname obj.name = new Classname();
